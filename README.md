# Microservices Playground

This repository is a **playground for exploring microservice architecture** using multiple programming languages and technologies. The goal is to experiment with service separation, API gateways, containerization, databases, and inter-service communication in a hands-on, real-world scenario.

---

## üß© Project Overview

The project consists of several independent services:

| Service | Language / Framework | Purpose |
|---------|--------------------|---------|
| **Auth Service** | Python / Django | User authentication and management |
| **Billing Service** | Go | Manages subscriptions and invoices |
| **Payment Service** | Python | Handles payments (gRPC) |
| **API Gateway** | Go | Routes requests to the appropriate service, handles CORS and authentication |
| **UI** | Node.js / React | Frontend interface to interact with services |

Services communicate through HTTP REST APIs (except Payment via gRPC) and are designed to run independently in **Docker containers**, simulating a realistic microservice environment.

- API Gateway with CORS handling and route proxying
- PostgreSQL database for Billing service
- Dockerized environment for easy local development
- Example models for subscriptions and invoices
- Hot-reload support for Go services with Air
- Extensible structure for experimenting with new services
